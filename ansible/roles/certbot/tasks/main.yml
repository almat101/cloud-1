# This task uses the community.docker.docker_compose_v2 module to control Docker Compose projects.
# - project_src: specifies the directory containing the docker-compose.yml file.
# - state: absent      # Equivalent to 'docker compose down' (stops and removes containers and networks)
# - state: present     # Equivalent to 'docker compose up -d' (starts containers in detached mode)
# - build: always      # Equivalent to adding '--build' to 'docker compose up', forcing a rebuild of images before starting containers
# - build: never       # Equivalent to adding '--no-build' to 'docker compose up', never building images before starting containers
# Reference: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/community/docker/docker_compose_v2_module.html
